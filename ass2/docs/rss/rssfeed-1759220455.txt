Bone Eater is currently in development for Japanese arcades, with an estimated launch date of later this year. An international arcade release is possible, though given the dearth of arcades elsewhere in the world, it's unlikely you'll ever see a Silent Scope: Bone Eater machine outside of Japan.[Image: Konami]No bones about it: Silent Scope returns to Japanese arcades originally appeared on Joystiq on Thu, 24 Jul 2014 13:30:00 EST.
