At debut Major Stryker received middling reviews and the game was released as freeware in 2006.What 3D Realms has planned for the archaic shooter is unknown - the only reason we know the above teaser is even related to Major Stryker is the video's title and its catchy music - but the tweet accompanying this footage urges fans to \"Get Ready for August!\" If you'd rather not wait, you can download Major Stryker from 3D Realms' website.[Image: 3D Realms]Out of nowhere, 3D Realms teases return of Major Stryker originally appeared on Joystiq on Thu, 24 Jul 2014 15:30:00 EST.
