The aim is to replicate all of the OTT silliness of sci-fi movie user-interfaces.\"Though Positech has yet to nail down a solid release date, Gratuitous Space Battles 2 should reach the PC, Mac and Linux platforms in late 2014 or early 2015. More information can be found on the game's newly-launched website.[Image: Positech Games]Continue reading Gratuitous Space Battles 2 coming soon to PC, Mac, LinuxGratuitous Space Battles 2 coming soon to PC, Mac, Linux originally appeared on Joystiq on Thu, 24 Jul 2014 16:00:00 EST.
