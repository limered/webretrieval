That much was revealed at E3 2013 by Nintendo, and further details on the game's online multiplayer offerings are now available via Famitsu (translation courtesy of Siliconera). The game's \"Tag Climax\" mode allows players to team up online with friends, strangers and CPU partners to annihilate waves of enemies and large bosses.Online quick matches will also feature a betting system, in which players can wager in-game \"Halos\" to challenge their partner in a scoring contest to see who will rack up the most points in a match. The in-game currency can then be exchanged for additional weapon variations, accessories and techniques. Players will have the ability to pick their characters and weapon\/accessory loadouts of choice as well as stages and their respective difficulty levels, with tougher matches resulting in higher Halos payouts (but at a steeper cost of entry). The equipment players carry in to Tag Climax mode is based on their progress in Bayonetta 2's main story mode as well. The game is slated to launch this October.Bayonetta 2's co-op mode bets on your success originally appeared on Joystiq on Fri, 25 Jul 2014 11:00:00 EST.
