Bungie is reintroducing Iron Banner challenges in a series of special Crucible events throughout this weekend, giving Beta veterans an incentive to take on new competition.To unlock the Iron Banner challenges, players must first visit Lord Saladin in Destiny's Tower hub area. Afterward, the Iron Banner can be accessed in a separate playlist within the Crucible. Make sure to hunt down some quality gear in the game's campaign mode first; Iron Banner matches do not place limits on player equipment, making your weapon and armor power levels key components to victory.Matches take place across 'Rusted Lands' on Earth, 'First Light' on the Moon, 'Shores of Time' on Venus, and 'Blind Watch' on Mars, with special awards and gear available for players who advance in rank. Iron Banner events will be held today from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m PDT, 2:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m., and 7:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m.Challenges will also be available tomorrow from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., 2:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m., and 7:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. [Image: Bungie]Iron Banner challenges return to Destiny Beta originally appeared on Joystiq on Fri, 25 Jul 2014 15:30:00 EST.
