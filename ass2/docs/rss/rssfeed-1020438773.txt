Some kind of announcement on that front sounds as if it could be coming soon based on a pair of tweets sent out by the 2K Games' international Twitter account.Both tweets were accompanied by the image above, which is an advertisement in the original BioShock for Eve's Garden, a strip club of sorts located in Rapture. The first tweet reads, \"#Discuss,\" while the second asks, \"Oooo, what COULD this mean?!\"According to the unofficial BioShock wiki, in addition to being located in the original BioShock, the Eve's Garden ad is also seen in BioShock 2's multiplayer mode.At this point, we have no other information to go on for what could be coming. Following Irrational's closure, Strauss Zelnick, the CEO of 2K parent company Take-Two, said in May, \"We haven't talked about what's going to happen to the franchise, but it's beloved.\"We'll be keeping an eye out for any further teases or details pertaining to this BioShock announcement.A BioShock game for PlayStation Vita was announced at E3 2011, but development on the title never started. Irrational creative director and BioShock creator Ken Levine said last year he hadn't given up hope for it, but earlier this year 2K refused to comment on its status. More recently, Levine revealed he had been thinking of the game as \"a Final Fantasy Tactics-style thing set in pre-fall Rapture.\"However, no doubt thanks in part to poor Vita sales, it doesn't look as if the game will ever happen. \"2K and Sony couldn't put a deal together when I last checked,\" Levine wrote on Twitter earlier this month. \"They seemed way more optimistic about this back in 2011.\"What are you hoping these teases are leading to?
