Until now, that is. A statement provided by a Crytek representative to Games Industry International claims that the company has been going through a \"transitional phase\" as it moves from being a development studio to an online publisher.\"Ultimately, with our organization, capitalization, portfolio and technologies we have now laid the foundations for securing Crytek's future - not just in the short term, but also long term,\" the note to Games Industry reads. \"Through this period of speculation, we are thankful for the support and encouragement we've received from our community and our partners, and for the contribution all of our staff have made. We remain committed to doing what we are best known for and trying to develop the best interactive experiences and technology possible for everyone who loves gaming.\"The statement also claims that while Crytek has secured the necessary capital to move forward, the company \"won't be communicating further details about our developments and progress.\" However, the note also closes with the hope that there will be positive news to share soon.
