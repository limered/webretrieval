Characters bear the same futuristic, decidedly Halo-esque aesthetic in both games, and actual game content appears to be the same, down to the infamous, ominpresent Peter Dinklage voiceover. Most impressively, the PlayStation 3 beta does an admirable job of providing a stable, fluid framerate, even when the screen is filled with explosive graphical effects.Obviously the PlayStation 4 version of Destiny looks and performs better than its PlayStation 3 counterpart, but if this comparison is any indicator, the older generation of hardware offers a perfectly suitable Destiny experience.[Image: Activision]Destiny beta comparison: PlayStation 3 versus PlayStation 4 originally appeared on Joystiq on Wed, 23 Jul 2014 13:30:00 EST.
