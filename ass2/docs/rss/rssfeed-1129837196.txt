A new version of Valve's Steam Controller includes an analog stick on the left-hand side, replacing a series of four directional buttons previously in its place. The new controller design still has two circular track pads, four lettered buttons, bumpers and triggers, among other features included in previous iterations.The new design shows up in the latest Steam client beta, as spotted by SteamDB and on the Facepunch forums (via Engadget).We've tried out previous Steam Controllers in the wild, and found the latest version to be functional but awkward: \"It's impressive that the Steam Controller can bounce between styles as disparate as 2D adventure and first-person puzzling, and its touch pads could become second nature over time, but it's definitely not going to provide a seamless transition from traditional controllers, at least not in its current state,\" our reviewer, Richard Mitchell, said.[Image: Valve]Updated Steam Controller adds an analog stick originally appeared on Joystiq on Wed, 23 Jul 2014 20:00:00 EST.
