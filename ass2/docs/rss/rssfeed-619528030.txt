Crystal Dynamics Executive Producer Scott Amos revealed the date to IGN, saying regards the wait, \"We look at this game and we put it together in a way that we just love it. It's a fan favorite, it's something that we want to do right.\"As we saw at E3 the follow-up to Guardian of Light plays as before, combining the intrepid explorer's world with top-down, twin-stick shooting and co-operative gameplay. The most obvious difference is the switch from two to four-player co-op, with Lara now joined by rival raider Carter and imprisoned Egyptian gods Horus and Isis.One welcome change from the original is that, according to Crystal Dynamics, both online and local co-op will be available at launch.[Image: Square Enix] Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris launching in December originally appeared on Joystiq on Wed, 23 Jul 2014 08:00:00 EST.
