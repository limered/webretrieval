Everest base camp for a private, early hands-on session with the game. Ubisoft urges entrants to \"be creative\" with their videos, and cautions that only those in \"very good physical condition\" will be eligible to join the expedition. Further, the winner must have a valid US passport and be willing to travel to Everest during the month of October.Assuming you meet all of these qualifications and can record something pithy and clever (but no more than two minutes in length), you can find details on where to submit your YouTube clip at the official contest website. Before you dash off to submit your entry though, keep in mind that the world's highest mountain has been particularly lethal this year.[Image: Ubisoft]Far Cry 4 promotional contest could send you to Mt.
