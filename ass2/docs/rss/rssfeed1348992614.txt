While this means the games (which include Plague Inc., Jetpack Joyride and Minecraft - Pocket Edition) won't automatically tap into the cloud for leaderboard updates and in-app purchase reminders, it also means your monthly phone bill won't suddenly inflate to ludicrous levels simply because you spent an especially boring afternoon at the DMV with only your portable device for entertainment.As Engadget points out, the Offline Games section is currently paltry when compared to the thousands of games otherwise available on Google Play, but it's a start. Hopefully more mobile developers will see this move as a reminder that not everyone has an unlimited data plan.[Image: Google]Google Play adds 'Offline Games' section originally appeared on Joystiq on Fri, 25 Jul 2014 19:00:00 EST.
