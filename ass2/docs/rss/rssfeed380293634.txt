So obviously, with all of the products, there&#039;s that special timing that we need for that to have its own spotlight. So on the marketing side, it&#039;s a special situation, but we can say that it hasn&#039;t been cancelled, so please relax.&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;&quot;&gt;It was almost four years ago to the day that a pair of crossover games featuring Street Fighter and Tekken were &lt;a href=&quot;http:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/articles\/two-street-fighter-tekken-crossovers-in-development\/1100-6270680\/&quot; data-ref-id=&quot;1100-6270680&quot;&gt;announced at San Diego Comic-Con 2010&lt;\/a&gt;. Capcom&#039;s offering, &lt;a href=&quot;\/street-fighter-x-tekken\/&quot; data-ref-id=&quot;false&quot;&gt;Street Fighter X Tekken&lt;\/a&gt;, came out less than two years later, but updates on Bandai Namco&#039;s title have been hard to come by. Harada &lt;a href=&quot;http:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/articles\/tekken-x-street-fighter-still-in-development\/1100-6412505\/&quot; data-ref-id=&quot;1100-6412505&quot;&gt;confirmed it was still in development&lt;\/a&gt; last year and indicated Bandai Namco was seeking &quot;the right time&quot; to release it. Earlier this year, it was &lt;a href=&quot;http:\/\/www.vg247.com\/2014\/02\/14\/tekken-x-street-fighter-still-on-namcos-2014-release-slate\/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; data-ref-id=&quot;false&quot;&gt;included&lt;\/a&gt; on the company&#039;s official release schedule for 2014, but without a specific release window attached.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;&quot;&gt;Harada was involved with a panel that covered the &lt;a href=&quot;http:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/articles\/tekken-7-announced-will-use-unreal-engine-4-update\/1100-6421088\/&quot; data-ref-id=&quot;1100-6421088&quot;&gt;recently announced&lt;\/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\/tekken-7\/&quot; data-ref-id=&quot;false&quot;&gt;Tekken 7&lt;\/a&gt; at SDCC today. Not much was revealed beyond the fact that fights will be one-on-one. The gameplay was also said to be unfinished, which is why the teaser trailer that was shown (above) offered no glimpse of the game in action.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;&quot;&gt;After so many years of waiting for Harada and Bandai Namco&#039;s take on blending of the Tekken and Street Fighter series, what are your expectations for the game at this point?
