Of the three new fighters, two are in the bantamweight division, as bantamweight champion TJ Dillashaw joins the roster along with Takeya Mizugaki. The third addition is in the welterweight division, Tyron Woodley.Additionally, the free update includes a number of bug fixes as well as some gameplay improvements. The developer added sprawl animations after defending power takedowns and the ability to throw extra shots at opponents that get knocked out in order to finish the fight. Plus, both power takedowns and side control sweeps have been removed from fighters that wouldn't normally be able to pull them off. For those that prefer being more cordial in their bouts, EA also added new glove-touching animations at the start of each round, which fighters can do by pressing L2 on PS4 or LT on Xbox One. To keep fights moving in EA Sports UFC, stamina will no longer regenerate for players that stand around and hold the block button, and they can break clinches when pressed against the cage by pressing L3.[Image: EA Sports]EA Sports UFC adds three fighters, finishes the fight originally appeared on Joystiq on Wed, 23 Jul 2014 10:30:00 EST.
