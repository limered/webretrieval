Ferrari, Jaguar, Lexus, Volkswagen, Ford, Audi and all the other manufacturers you'd expect are included, and alongside the typical high-powered sports cars, the Forza Horizon 2 roster even includes a few novelty vehicles, such as the World War 2-era 1945 Jeep Willys and the countercultural icon 1963 VW Type 2 De Luxe van. Notably absent are any vehicles from Porsche, though given the manufacturer's long-standing licensing agreement with EA that omission should come as little surprise.For a full rundown of the first 100 vehicles included in Forza Horizon 2, pay a visit to the Xbox Wire website.[Image: Microsoft]Microsoft unveils 100 cars from Forza Horizon 2 garage originally appeared on Joystiq on Tue, 22 Jul 2014 22:30:00 EST.
