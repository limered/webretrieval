In addition to developing games like Crysis and the original Far Cry, it&#039;s also responsible for the CryEngine game engine, which has been used in a number of non-Crytek games, including upcoming titles &lt;a href=&quot;\/evolve\/&quot; data-ref-id=&quot;false&quot;&gt;Evolve&lt;\/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;\/star-citizen\/&quot; data-ref-id=&quot;false&quot;&gt;Star Citizen&lt;\/a&gt;.

Having already given an update to staff across all our studios, we are now in a position to share more details with members of the press and public.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Internally, we have acknowledged that the flow of information to employees has not been as good as it should have, however we hope you understand that communicating details of our plans publicly has not always been possible.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like the games industry as a whole, Crytek has been in a transitional phase. Our evolution from a development studio to an Online-Publisher has required us to refocus our strategies. These challenges go along with an increased demand for capital which we have secured.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;We can now concentrate on the long term strategic direction of Crytek and our core competencies. We kindly ask for your understanding, that we won&#039;t be communicating further details about our developments and progress.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ultimately, with our organization, capitalization, portfolio and technologies we have now laid the foundations for securing Crytek\u2019s future \u2013 not just in the short term, but also long term.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Through this period of speculation, we are thankful for the support and encouragement we&#039;ve received from our community and our partners, and for the contribution all of our staff have made.
