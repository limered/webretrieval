But sometimes, you just gotta step outside your comfort zone and try something new. Something like the Tomodachi Life-inspired stage for Super Smash Bros. coming to 3DS this October, perhaps.Game director Masahiro Sakurai revealed today that Super Smash Bros. for 3DS - and only the 3DS version - will feature a stage based on the recently-released Tomodachi Life. What's more, it will pull the Mii data from your 3DS so that when you come crashing through an apartment, it could be you or your friends' place you see.Sakurai also noted that the placement of rooms will be randomized, and that there are several different types of rooms for the game to choose from. While initially it looks as though areas of the level are closed off, walls will fade away when a fighter occupies the room it hides. Sakurai hinted that placing a bomb in an apartment might be a good idea, which is a great example of a thought that would be utterly terrifying if it weren't about a video game.[Image: Nintendo]Tomodachi Life stage lets you live inside Super Smash Bros. originally appeared on Joystiq on Thu, 24 Jul 2014 21:30:00 EST.
