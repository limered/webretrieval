In fact, a good portion of the company&#039;s total revenue came from used games--about $1.2 billion per year. For the company to grow this number, it&#039;s going to have to expose trade-ins to more people, something that Bartel acknowledges: &quot;What we&#039;re constantly trying to do is create awareness. We&#039;ll continue to do that. The Power Up Rewards [program] is a powerful tool for us to drive awareness of our trade program. You&#039;ll see it in our stores. You&#039;ll see it in interactions with our store associates. We&#039;re on a constant quest to inform the public that there\u2019s a residual value for your games.&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;At the same time, GameStop has been capitalizing on the growth of the digital games market even in its physical stores. Last week, GameStop revealed that most of its digital sales (via season passes, credit codes, etc.) &lt;a href=&quot;http:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/articles\/gamestop-were-on-offense-when-it-comes-to-digital\/1100-6421155\/&quot; data-ref-id=&quot;1100-6421155&quot;&gt;came from brick-and-mortar locations&lt;\/a&gt;.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;The company is also seeking&lt;a href=&quot;http:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/articles\/gamestop-might-participate-in-game-development-to-\/1100-6420964\/&quot; data-ref-id=&quot;1100-6420964&quot;&gt; to get involved earlier in game development&lt;\/a&gt; to further its preorder bonus program, but its CEO promised that it &lt;a href=&quot;http:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/articles\/gamestop-wont-be-involved-in-creative-process-ceo-\/1100-6421033\/&quot; data-ref-id=&quot;1100-6421033&quot;&gt;would not meddle with the creative process&lt;\/a&gt;.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;Do you trade in old games at GameStop?
