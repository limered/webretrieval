Also of note is the fact that what&#039;s seen in the video is not necessarily indicative of what the rest of the game will look like.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&quot;This is not the look for the entire game,&quot; Perna says. &quot; This, in my mind, represents kind of the sci-fi\/industrial look. We could go grimier with this.&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;div data-height=&quot;100%&quot; data-width=&quot;100%&quot; data-src=&quot;http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=z8Nlz7XonCs&quot; data-embed-type=&quot;video&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;\/\/cdn.embedly.com\/widgets\/media.html?src=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fz8Nlz7XonCs%3Fwmode%3Dopaque%26feature%3Doembed&amp;amp;wmode=opaque&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dz8Nlz7XonCs&amp;amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fz8Nlz7XonCs%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;amp;key=6efca6e5ad9640f180f14146a0bc1392&amp;amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;amp;schema=youtube&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen&gt;&lt;\/iframe&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;&quot;&gt;Perna also talked about the overall look he wants to have in the game, drawing on the &lt;em&gt;Batman&lt;\/em&gt; films to illustrate his point. &quot;To me, Unreal--and the entire franchise--has always been, I used to use this term a lot, a Tim Burton &lt;em&gt;Batman&lt;\/em&gt;-type of caricature of itself,&quot; Perna explains.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&quot;And where I&#039;d like to go with the new franchise is more of a Chris Nolan kind of&lt;em&gt; Batman Begins&lt;\/em&gt;\u2026 just something a little more polished, a little more realis[tic], but without going over the top and doing kind of like what we did with Gears [of War] or [Unreal Tournament 3] and making everything dark and grimy and grungy. I think you can still have detailed environments that look amazing, and add color, and have visual clarity--and have your cake and eat it, too, basically.&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;&quot;&gt;The new Unreal Tournament &lt;a href=&quot;http:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/articles\/new-unreal-tournament-in-development-and-it-ll-be-absolutely-free\/1100-6419511\/&quot; data-ref-id=&quot;1100-6419511&quot;&gt;was announced back in May&lt;\/a&gt;. It will be developed by a small team and will be completely free when it&#039;s released. To make money, Epic will take a cut of sales through a store it will offer that allows modders to sell content to players. Epic has been doing regular live streams featuring discussions with its developers, who are working with the game&#039;s community to design the game.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;What do you think about the look of this map and what Perna&#039;s vision is for the game?
