Speaking to Red Bull, game director Paul Rustchynsky said, \"I can see why players assume that a higher frame rate means better quality, because in pretty much every other technical statistic the higher numbers directly translate to better performance and more detail.\"However, he believes developer Evolution struck the right balance between technical performance and frame rate, insisting the racer doesn't drop frames or feature any noticeable input lag. Those are features that \"[many] of the games running at 60fps can't guarantee,\" he said. \"With high frame rates, you've got to sacrifice a lot of detail, and ultimately we're really satisfied that we've got a great balance of a racing game that looks stunning and plays beautifully.\"Some PlayStation 4 owners expressed their disappointment when Evolution confirmed the 30fps cap, cutting it from a previously promised 60fps. Rustchynsky told Edge in April how the frame rate cap wouldn't compromise the gameplay for Driveclub, saying 1080p\/30fps was \"absolutely the best thing\" for the racer. He mentioned to Red Bull how players at E3 were pleased with the \"fluid\" racer.The game director didn't rule out the possibility of 1080p\/60fps in future games on PlayStation 4, believing developers at this stage have barely grasped the full power of the system. \"Looking back at what we've been able to do in the past two years, and how we're continually finding new ways of getting even more performance out of the hardware, I don't think we're anywhere close to reaching the limit of what the PS4 can do yet,\" said Rustchynsky.Driveclub launches exclusively for PlayStation 4 on October 7.Does the 30fps cap your interest in Driveclub?
