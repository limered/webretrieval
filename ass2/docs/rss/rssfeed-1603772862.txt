Along with updated versions of Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix, Kingdom Hearts: Birth By Sleep Final Mix and Kingdom Hearts: Re: Coded, those who score a copy of the Limited Edition will also receive a nifty pin featuring Sora and Mickey.Now, a pin may not seem like a big fuss, but this is an official, collectible Disney pin - and thus, it is part of the pin trading tradition that officially kicked off in 1999. Disney pin trading is serious business to those with a passion for it, as some pins have reached prices upward of $1,000 on the secondhand market.So you take care of that pin, young man\/lady! It just might be worth something someday.[Image: Square Enix]Stick a pin in your Kingdom Hearts 2.5 HD Remix pre-order originally appeared on Joystiq on Thu, 24 Jul 2014 19:00:00 EST.
