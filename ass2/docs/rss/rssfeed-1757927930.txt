Epiphany Games is playing off these types of conspiracies with its freshly-announced episodic game, Majestic Nights, which will debut in September. In the alternate 1980s game, these sorts of conspiracies aren't just theories, but are \"truths.\" Players guide an intelligence operative known as Cardholder and a private investigator named Cal in the isometric RPG, uncovering clues to the criminal cover-ups and world-breaking facts about events like alien abductions.The first season of Majestic Nights includes six episodes and kicks off with a \"Chapter Zero\" prologue for free in September, which dives into the aforementioned moon landing. Majestic Nights' subsequent chapters will come at a cost; the first is expected to arrive in October, with the season's conclusive sixth episode currently slated for April 2015. The game is in development for PC, Mac, iOS and Android, and while Epiphany didn't put a price to each chapter, season passes will be available for players to guarantee access to the whole shebang.[Image: Epiphany Games]Continue reading Alternate 1980s RPG Majestic Nights is one big conspiracyAlternate 1980s RPG Majestic Nights is one big conspiracy originally appeared on Joystiq on Wed, 23 Jul 2014 17:30:00 EST.
