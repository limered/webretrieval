The settlement may result in Sony doling out as much as $17.75 million, which includes an offer for one free game (PS3 or PSP only), three PS3 themes or credit for three months of PlayStation Plus membership (valid only for new subscribers).The claimant groups are divided based on whether PSN account holders prior to May 15, 2011 took advantage of the \"Welcome Back\" program following the intrusion.  Those that did not accept the PSN Welcome Back offer can claim two of the benefit options among the games, themes and PS Plus membership credit on a first come, first served basis until a $6 million allocation from Sony is reached. For those that did take advantage of the program, they will receive one of the benefits above until a $4 million allocation is reached.Continue reading Court approves settlement over Sony's 2011 PSN breachCourt approves settlement over Sony's 2011 PSN breach originally appeared on Joystiq on Thu, 24 Jul 2014 11:32:00 EST.
