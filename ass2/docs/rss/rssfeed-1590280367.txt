But Stoic also learned one important thing in its work, especially as it collaborated with Apple: mobile gamers tend to be reluctant to spend any money.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;Talking to &lt;a href=&quot;http:\/\/www.polygon.com\/2014\/7\/24\/5931351\/why-banner-saga-is-avoiding-the-budget-price-pitfall-of-the-app-store&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; data-ref-id=&quot;false&quot;&gt;Polygon&lt;\/a&gt;, founders Arnie Jorgensen and John Watson discussed how the team always aimed to bring the game to iOS, but the environment turned out to be too volatile. As a result, the studio decided to begin with the PC. Watson explained, &quot;For this game, we felt like it was sort of a niche genre. We felt like our core audience was on PC, on Steam, so there&#039;s that.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;blockquote data-align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&quot;[People will] spend $600 on an iPad, and $4 on a coffee, drop $20 on lunch, but when it comes to spending four or five dollars on a game, it&#039;s this life-altering decision.&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/blockquote&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&quot;On the other side of the coin, shipping a game on iOS was a big question mark. Are people going to buy it? I don&#039;t know. How much can we sell it for? Not very much. We saw it as a bigger risk; what if we spent a year or two years making this, put it out on iOS, and we were just sunk? It just felt like Steam was a better fit for this \u2014 not a \u2018better fit,&#039; really, but more of a slam dunk.&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;And now, seven months after the game&#039;s release on the PC, the developer has the stability and security to port it to tablets. But it&#039;s not a cheap project, and so The Banner Saga will cost money. The biggest question is, then, how much will it cost? This is a problem that Stoic has struggled with during the game&#039;s development.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;figure data-align=&quot;right&quot; data-size=&quot;small&quot; data-img-src=&quot;http:\/\/static1.gamespot.com\/uploads\/original\/1539\/15391776\/2608235-3749697533-24180.jpg&quot; data-ref-id=&quot;1300-2608235&quot; data-resize-url=&quot;&quot; data-resized=&quot;&quot; data-embed-type=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:\/\/static1.gamespot.com\/uploads\/original\/1539\/15391776\/2608235-3749697533-24180.jpg&quot; data-ref-id=&quot;1300-2608235&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http:\/\/static2.gamespot.com\/uploads\/ignore_jpg_scale_small\/1539\/15391776\/2608235-3749697533-24180.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/figure&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;In fact, both Apple and Stoic have grown frustrated with the increasing reticence of mobile gamers to spend any money. Stoic&#039;s discussions with Apple have revealed that the tech giant is working hard to overcome this trend. Watson said, &quot;Apple is frustrated, along with everybody else, about the mentality that&#039;s gone rampant in mobile app markets, where people don&#039;t want to pay anything. They think that four dollars is an exorbitant amount to pay for a game, which is very illogical considering most people&#039;s lifestyles. They&#039;ll spend $600 on an iPad, and $4 on a coffee, drop $20 on lunch, but when it comes to spending four or five dollars on a game, it&#039;s this life-altering decision. I&#039;m frustrated with that too.&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;He continues, &quot;Apple clearly knows this, and I think they&#039;re hoping developers are going to be using that on iPad Air, because it can push it now. So they&#039;re telling us to go higher-end with our game. We&#039;re still making those decisions.&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;&quot;&gt;The Banner Saga launches on iOS and Android tablets this summer.
