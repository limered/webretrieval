The skyline at Petco Park in San Diego features more buildings in the background, and the four flagpoles just beyond left center field actually have flags now, flapping in the breeze.The PS4 version of MLB 14 is much crisper in its details, thanks to much sharper textures. Hair now stands out on players' heads, and close-ups of their faces show more freckles and blemishes. While players' overall facial structures haven't changed, Sony San Diego wasn't afraid to bring the camera closer to players on PS4 to show off the details, as seen in post-game celebrations, for instance.

I spotted spectators walking through a distant hall past right field, beyond a sea of people that appeared to move more independently than on PS3. Even without the same visual fidelity found in the athletes themselves, cut-scenes featuring fans looked more natural and (dare I say) \"human.\" The crowd's booming cheers and hastened quieting sounded a bit more reactive and pulled to the front of the game with its bump in volume.Continue reading MLB 14: The Show PS4 review: Pretty as a pitcherMLB 14: The Show PS4 review: Pretty as a pitcher originally appeared on Joystiq on Tue, 06 May 2014 16:00:00 EST.
