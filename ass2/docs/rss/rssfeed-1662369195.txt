Bungie did not specify what the reward is, but free is free, so be sure to hop on this weekend if you're intrigued. Here's hoping that it's a gold-plated Peter Dinklage-bot. Or new character dances. Or a dancing Dinklage-bot.[Update: Bungie confirmed that the featured reward is an in-game emblem.] [Image: Bungie]Play Destiny's Beta on Saturday, get a reward in the full version originally appeared on Joystiq on Wed, 23 Jul 2014 16:31:00 EST.
