There are pigs and cows lurking around, and farmer characters to select, but you will not be collecting the harvest. Put away your thoughts of hovering tractors flying through fields of off-color fruits and vegetables. Instead of the zero gravity crop simulator you might expect from Steam in 2014, Space Farmers is instead a co-op puzzle game put out by the BumpkinBrothers. Its a game thats full of cleaver hooks and the kind of great moments you can only get when playing with a friend, but its held back by a bizarre progression that forces you to solve the same puzzles over and over again. Combine that with a nonexistent online community, and Space Farmers becomes something to pull out at parties or with a buddy, a fleeting fancy rather than a must have experience.\" - Alex Santa Maria of Geekenstein","title":"Space Farmers Review | Geekenstein"}}
